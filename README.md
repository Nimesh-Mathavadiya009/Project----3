I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve just completed a new REST API project! in this i don't focus on designing part but This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to dive deeper into backend development and refine my skills in Node.js and Express.js.


#Project Overview:

I created a REST API that handles CRUD operations for user posts. This 

includes:

::= Creating new posts

::= Reading existing posts

::= Updating posts

::= Deleting posts



#Tech Stack:

 Node.js: The backbone of our server-side logic.

 Express.js: Simplified the routing and middleware setup.

 EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Used for rendering HTML templates.


#Data Handling:

For this project, I used an array of objects as dummy data to simulate     database interactions. This approach allowed me to focus on the API logic without the overhead of database management.


#Challenges & Learnings:

One of the main challenges was ensuring the API's robustness and handling edge cases efficiently. I learned a lot about error handling in Express.js and 

the importance of clear API documentation.
